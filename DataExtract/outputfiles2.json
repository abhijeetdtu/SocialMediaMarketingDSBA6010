The oils help to reverse roughness and dullness without hair feeling weighed down. The non-drip formula has no ammonia, so it smells great as you apply. The end result? More brilliant, long-lasting color and hair that is hydrated, silky, looks full and up to 3x shinier than uncolored, unwashed hair. What's in the hair dye kit? A developer applicator, a colorant tube, after color conditioner, as well as a set of gloves and the instruction sheet. Packaging May Vary\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t"
