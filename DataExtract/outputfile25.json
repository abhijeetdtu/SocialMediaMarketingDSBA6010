    "description": "From the manufacturer Size:1 Count \u00a0|\u00a0 Color:7.20 Dark Rose Quartz Garnier Olia is unlike any other traditional, permanent hair color. Powered by a 60% oil blend formula with natural flower oils, Olia propels colorants deep into the hair, giving you vivid color results and 100% gray coverage. The oils help to reverse roughness and dullness without hair feeling weighed down. The non-drip formula has no ammonia, so it smells great as you apply. The end result? More brilliant, long-lasting color and hair that is hydrated, silky, looks full and up to 3x shinier than uncolored, unwashed hair. What's in the hair dye kit? A developer applicator, a colorant tube, after color conditioner, as well as a set of gloves and the instruction sheet. Packaging May Vary\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t"
